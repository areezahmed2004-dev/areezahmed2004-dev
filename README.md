Hi, I’m Areez Ahmed 

I’m a senior at Indiana University studying **Finance** and **Business Analytics**, with a strong interest in applying data, analytics, and financial modeling to real-world business problems.

I enjoy working on projects that combine finance, data analysis, and technology, and I’m currently building a portfolio that demonstrates my skills in tools like Python, Excel, and statistical analysis. I’m especially interested in roles within consulting, corporate finance, and analytical finance functions.
